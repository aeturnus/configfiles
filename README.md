# configfiles
This repo contains configuration files for the Linux environment that I prefer to work in.

It also has an installation script that copies (and backs up if the file(s) exist(s)) the
configuration files to their necessary places.

## Dependencies
No real dependencies, but it has configuration files for various programs and applications.
* zsh
* vim
* tmux
* git
* i3
* rxvt-unicode (urxvt)
